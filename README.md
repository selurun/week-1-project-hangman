Guess which country is hiden behind. 

## About the Game
Hangman is a simple word guessing game. Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).

Setup the game by drawing a gallow and a underline for each letter in the unknown word. As letters in the word are guessed, write them above the cooresponding underline. If a letter not in the word is guess, draw a picture of a person on the gallow–one part for each incorrect letter guess. 

### How to 
The player must guess the letter of a hidden word, with each wrong guess resulting in a piece being added to a gallows, with the game ending either when the gallows is completed or when the word has been fully guessed. 

### Rules
The player has 4 attempts.

### Objective
Guess letters to fill in the blanks before your little man gets hung.
